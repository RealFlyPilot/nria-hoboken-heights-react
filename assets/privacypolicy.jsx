					<p>This is the privacy notice of:</p>
					<p>National Realty Investment Advisors, LLC</p>
					<p>1325 Paterson Plank Road, 2nd Floor</p>
					<p>Secaucus, New Jersey 07094</p>
					<p>In this document, “we”, “our”, or “us” refer to National Realty Investment Advisors, LLC</p>
					<p>Introduction</p>
					<p>This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.</p>
					<p>We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.</p>
					<p>We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.</p>
					<p>We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.</p>
					<p>Our policy complies with United States law accordingly implemented, as well as that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
					<p>The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at www.knowyourprivacyrights.org</p>
					<p>Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.</p>
					<p>The bases on which we process information about you</p>
					<p>The GDPR law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.</p>
					<p>If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.</p>
					<p>If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.</p>
					<p>1. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you</p>
					<p>When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.</p>
					<p>In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.</p>
					<p>We may use it in order to:</p>
					<p>1.1. verify your identity for security purposes</p>
					<p>1.2. sell products to you</p>
					<p>1.3. provide you with our services</p>
					<p>1.4. provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website</p>
					<p>We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.</p>
					<p>Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.</p>
					<p>We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.</p>
					<p>2. Information we process with your consent</p>
					<p>Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including job opportunities and our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.</p>
					<p>Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies.</p>
					<p>Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.</p>
					<p>Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.</p>
					<p>We do not sell your personal information to any third party.</p>
					<p>We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.</p>
					<p>You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at info@nria.net. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use our website or our services further.</p>
					<p>3. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests</p>
					<p>We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.</p>
					<p>Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:</p>
					<p>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</p>
					<p>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</p>
					<p>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so</p>
					<p>For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:</p>
					<p>record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business</p>
					<p>responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response</p>
					<p>protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</p>
					<p>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage our business risk</p>
					<p>protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so</p>
					<p>4. Information we process because we have a legal obligation</p>
					<p>We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.</p>
					<p>For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorization such as a search warrant or court order.</p>
					<p>This may include your personal information.</p>
					<p>Specific Uses Of Information You Provide To Us</p>
					<p>5. Information relating to your method of payment</p>
					<p>While we do keep records of past purchases, including the last 4 digits of any credit card used to make a purchase from us, we do not store your complete payment information on our own servers. All of our payments are processed securely through Stripe.</p>
					<p>6. Job application and employment</p>
					<p>If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it in case we decide to contact you at a later date.</p>
					<p>If we employ you, we collect information about you and your work from time to time throughout the period of your employment. This information will be used only for purposes directly relevant to your employment. After your employment has ended, we may keep your file for our records unless you specifically ask us to destroy it by emailing us your request at info@nria.net. Upon receiving this request, we may seek legal counsel before complying, and we may or may not grant your request, depending on the advice that we receive from our lawyers.</p>
					<p>7. Sending a message to our support team</p>
					<p>When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.</p>
					<p>We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.</p>
					<p>We may keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service. We do not share this information with any outside party.</p>
					<p>8. Complaining</p>
					<p>When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.</p>
					<p>We use that information to resolve your complaint.</p>
					<p>If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.</p>
					<p>We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.</p>
